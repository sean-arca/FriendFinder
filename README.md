# FriendFinder
No New Friends, No New Friends, No, No New? Use this friend finder to find new friends asap!

## Working Demo
Please checkout [My Heroku](https://afternoon-peak-27962.herokuapp.com/) for a deployed version.

## Description
This is a node based application which simulates a dating platform. The user will answer a series of 10 questions with values from 1 (Strong Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). After the questions have been answered, FriendFinder will tally the points of the current user, then match the user with an existing user based on the point differential. The existing user whose point differential is closest to the current user's, becomes the match.

## Installtion
To install, clone this repo locally (https://github.com/sean-arca/FriendFinder.git), npm install, then node/nodemon server.js in your console.

## Technology
The application is implemented using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server on the back end.
